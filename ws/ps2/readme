ps2.py
Written by Trevor Toryk

A simple web service exposing a few methods for accessing pstat on a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RCS server.

To run ps2.py you'll need Python2 (preferably 2.7.X) and the following (pip-installable) libraries:

pytz
spyne
lxml (>=2.3)
werkzeug
simplejson

As well as libraries for whichever transport-layer implementation you choose to use (i.e. Twisted, Django, Pyramid).  You could also skip them and run the app directly in uWSGI or Apache's mod_wsgi.
